# Face-Eyes-Mouth-Smile-dectection-
This project uses Python and OpenCV to detect faces, eyes, mouths, and smiles in images or videos. It finds the face first, then looks for the eyes and mouth within it, and finally detects if the person is smiling. The program highlights these features with boxes, useful for apps, games, and security systems
